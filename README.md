# Fe Allocator 

### This project is an attempt to replicate the [tiny alloc](https://github.com/thi-ng/umbrella/tree/develop/packages/malloc) in the EVM 

## Public interface 
 
### For the initial stage, the public interface of the memory pool class will include the following: 

#### Allocate

   Returns a pointer (as a u256) to address in heap space or 0 if allocation failed  

#### Reallocate 

   Attempts to adjust the size of the block at the given allocated address to new size or if not possible, attempt to allocate a new block and copies contents of current block (if successful, automatically frees old address). Returns new address if successful or else 0.

#### Free

   Releases given address or array view back into the pool. Returns true if successful.

#### Free All

   Frees all allocated blocks, essentially resets the pool.

#### listStats

   Returns pool statistics


## Coalescing && Splitting:

### Further optimizations that are being performed under the hood in order to preserver memory space, the goal of each is the following

#### Coalescing
 
   The allocator supports coalescing of free memory blocks to minimize fragmentation of the managed address space.

#### Splitting 

   In order to avoid unnecessary growing of the heap top, the allocator can split existing free blocks if the user requests allocating a smaller size than that of a suitable free block available.

## Memory layout 

### A single memory block consists of:

#### Size

   The size of the block (inluding header & padding)

#### Next
 
   Pointer to next block of the same type (free, used)

#### Data

   Data to be held inside the block (depending on how this project pans out, this can be a memory buffer)

### The following constants that can be found in the code, represent the following values

#### free 

   pointer to first free block header
#### used 

  pointer to first used block header

#### top

   address of next new block header

#### end

   end address of managed region 

#### minSplit 

   minimum block size allowed for splitting

###### this project is still a WIP, the initial stage is not complete
